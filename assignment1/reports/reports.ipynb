    "*Zipf's law* is one of the most powerful statistical law that the frequency distribution of words in a language obeys a linear pattern when plotting the word frequency and its rank. In this section, we empirically evaluate Zipf's law on 4 corpus and across 3 languages. We receive the similar results when plotting the Zipf's law by two charts with the linear axes and the log axes. We also demonstrate that the law holds in mostly parts of line, namely the line with mostly perfectly slope -1.  We uses the King James Bible, the Jungle Book and the SEtimes Turkish-Bulgarian parallel newspaper text for our experiements."

First, **the King James Bible (KJB)**  is an English translation of the Christian Bible which consists of 31102 sentences. Second, **the Jungle Book** is a collection of stories which has roughly 54887 words counting from segments. For last two corpora, we use parallel news texts, **SETimes Turkish-Bulgarian corpus**, which base on the SETimes.com news portal and consist 206071 parallel sentences in both Turkish and Bulgarian language."

For each corpus, we count its word frequency and store word-frequency pair as kay-value mapping in a dictionary sorting by descending order. We tokenize sentence by whitespace and remain all stop words and punctuation remarks. Because it does not effect the result of zipf's law. In implementation, we collect all corpus on a folder and preprocess them within a loop. We dump the word-frequnecy pairs to a `.json` file for each corpus."

It's convience to us for observing the results when displaying horizontally. We will display the results and disccuss it on next section. For intance, our plotting function was designed to draw both the linear and the log line charts by using the methods `plt.subplots.plot()` and `plt.subplot.loglog()` provided by `matplotlib` library.
