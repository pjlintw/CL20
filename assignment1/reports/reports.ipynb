    "*Zipf's law* is one of the most powerful statistical law that the frequency distribution of words in a language obeys a linear pattern when plotting the word frequency and its rank. In this section, we empirically evaluate Zipf's law on 4 corpus and across 3 languages. We receive the similar results when plotting the Zipf's law by two charts with the linear axes and the log axes. We also demonstrate that the law holds in mostly parts of line, namely the line with mostly perfectly slope -1.  We uses the King James Bible, the Jungle Book and the SEtimes Turkish-Bulgarian parallel newspaper text for our experiements."

Second, **the Jungle Book** is a collection of stories which has roughly 54887 words counting from segments.

For example, the PMI score for a common phrase **(take into)** is 0 since the word pair doesn't appear in the dataset.
