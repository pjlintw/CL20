    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IBM Model 1 assumes that each word in the target sentence is a translation of exactly zero or one word of the source sentence. However, the translation quality obtained from word-by-word translation isn't fluent and readable. Additionally, the result does not always cover the necessary meaning from source sentence. In this work, we tackle these problems by leveraging **phrase-based translation model**. The model estimate the conditional probability built on the extracted phrases from word alignment. We implement the **phrase extraction model** and the **beam-search decoder** for translation. It demonstrates that the results from phrase-based model gain the improvements in terms of the fluency and the adequacy. It is capable to translate short sentences in French correctly and assigns correct English phrase to corresponding French phrase. We discuss the experiements and results in the third section."
